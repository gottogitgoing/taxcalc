# TaxCalc
For aggregated amounts representing the income for a given week, or for the given yearly gross income this useful Bash script will generate tax information for sole traders in Australia. It is handy for people who from week to week do not know what their gross income will be. 

## Installation
Place the file named taxcalc to a directory listed anywhere in your $PATH variable. Alternatively it can be run by calling bash explicitly in the current directory i.e. bash taxcalc --help for the help message.
